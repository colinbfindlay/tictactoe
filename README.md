# Tic Tac Toe

## Description:
Mit Exercise to demonstrate several React Components.  We learned about Parent vs. Child components.  Mounting and Mounting.  And using the ReactDOM vs. Rendering in the browser DOM.

## How to Run:
1. Clone Repository to your local environment.
2. Open index.html in a Web Browser. 

## Roadmap for Future Improvements:
1. When a Player Wins, have the 3 squares that make a line change colour.
2. Have a 'Play Again' button, that resets the game.
